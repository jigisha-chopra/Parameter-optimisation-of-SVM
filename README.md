# Parameter-optimisation-of-SVM
This project aims to explore the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in solving classification problems, with a focus on parameter optimization. In this project, we have taken a dataset and created 10 random samples to train and test our SVM model. Our goal was to identify the best SVM parameters that can yield the highest accuracy for each of the 10 samples.

The final result of our project is a table that shows the accuracy of each of the 10 samples, along with the best SVM parameters that yielded the highest accuracy. This table can be used as a reference for future classification problems that require SVM parameter optimization.

Dataset name- Letter recognition Data Set

Data set description:

The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15. We typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000. See the article cited above for more details.
